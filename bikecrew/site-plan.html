          It is common for a cyclist to enjoy cycling in more than one discipline. For example, a track cyclist may enjoy riding on the road. A BMX rider may also enjoy riding in the mountains.

Here we could help those groups to be more visible and to reach more people, and anyone who wants to join a group to go out and practice this sport can find it.
